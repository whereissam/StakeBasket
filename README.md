# **StakeBasket**

**A multi-asset staking ETF platform on Core blockchain for CORE and lstBTC yield optimization.**

StakeBasket is a decentralized ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) that allows users to deposit assets and automatically receive exposure to optimized staking strategies across the Core blockchain ecosystem, a Bitcoin-aligned, EVM-compatible Layer-1 blockchain.1 Users deposit native CORE tokens and receive BASKET tokens representing their proportional share of the fund's diversified staking portfolio.

## **The CoreDAO DeFi Challenge**

As the CoreDAO ecosystem grows, users face increasing complexity in identifying and managing optimal staking strategies for assets like CORE and lstBTC. This often leads to:

* **Liquidity Fragmentation:** Suboptimal capital efficiency due to assets being spread across various staking protocols.  
* **High Complexity:** A deep understanding of DeFi mechanics and constant monitoring is required, creating a disjointed and time-consuming experience.  
* **Suboptimal Yields:** Manual management of multiple assets (native CORE staking and lstBTC) for yield optimization is challenging, leading to missed opportunities for maximized returns.

## **Our Solution: StakeBasket**

StakeBasket simplifies DeFi yield farming by providing a professionally managed, ETF-like solution on CoreDAO. We offer:

* **Multi-Asset Staking ETF:** Diversified, optimized exposure to CORE and lstBTC staking yields through a single, liquid token (BASKET).  
* **Automated Yield Optimization:** Intelligent allocation and rebalancing across best-performing staking strategies within the CoreDAO ecosystem.  
* **Simplified DeFi Access:** Abstracting complex yield farming mechanics into a user-friendly, set-and-forget experience.  
* **Enhanced Capital Efficiency:** Maximizing returns by dynamically deploying capital across high-yield opportunities.

## **How StakeBasket Works**

StakeBasket streamlines the process of diversified staking and yield optimization. Users deposit native CORE and/or lstBTC into the StakeBasket smart contract and, in return, receive BASKET tokens, representing their proportional share of the underlying diversified fund. The StakeBasket smart contracts, managed by the StakingManager, automatically deploy these deposited assets into optimized staking strategies for CORE (delegation) and lstBTC (liquid staking platforms). Our optional backend services (or future decentralized automation) continuously monitor market conditions and validator performance, automatically rebalancing the portfolio to maximize yield and manage risk. Yields generated from the underlying strategies are compounded back into the fund, increasing the Net Asset Value (NAV) of each BASKET token over time. Users can redeem their BASKET tokens at any time to withdraw their share of the fund, including accumulated yields.

## **Our Competitive Edge on CoreDAO**

StakeBasket is positioned to be a leading solution for yield optimization within the CoreDAO ecosystem due to several key advantages:

* **The First Multi-Asset Staking ETF on CoreDAO:** Pioneering a new standard for diversified, hands-off yield optimization specifically tailored for the CoreDAO blockchain, leveraging its unique non-custodial Bitcoin staking capabilities, which has already secured over 5,200 BTC valued at over $300 million since its launch in April 2024\.5  
* **Optimized Exposure to CoreDAO Bluechips:** Directly connects users to the highest-performing staking opportunities for CORE and lstBTC without manual management.  
* **Professional-Grade Automation:** Our robust backend provides enterprise-level rebalancing, real-time monitoring, and risk management for superior fund performance.  
* **Enhanced Capital Efficiency:** Consolidates multiple staking positions into a single, liquid BASKET token, simplifying portfolio management and maximizing overall returns.  
* **Robust Security & Transparency:** Built with battle-tested OpenZeppelin contracts and comprehensive testing, ensuring a secure and verifiable investment vehicle.  
* **Seamless User Experience:** A modern, intuitive UI coupled with multi-wallet support makes DeFi yield farming accessible to a broader audience on CoreDAO.  
* **Leveraging CoreDAO's Robust Security:** Built on a foundation secured by CoreDAO's Satoshi Plus consensus mechanism, which integrates Bitcoin's hash power for unparalleled security, with over 55% of the global Bitcoin hashrate currently contributing to its security.1

## **Why Now? The CoreDAO Opportunity**

The timing is critical for StakeBasket on CoreDAO:

* **Growing CoreDAO DeFi Ecosystem:** The CoreDAO blockchain's DeFi ecosystem is experiencing significant growth in TVL, with over $800 million claimed by CoreDAO and $432.58 million reported by DefiLlama, including $189.94 million in Colend Protocol and $163.12 million in DeSyn Protocol, and user adoption, creating a ripe environment for advanced financial primitives like ETFs.9  
* **Evolving Staking Landscape:** As restaking derivatives and diverse yield opportunities emerge on CoreDAO, including its planned Liquid Bitcoin Staking (LSTs) and Bitcoin Re-Staking initiatives, which aim to further enhance security and liquidity functionality derived from Bitcoin, users will increasingly seek simplified, optimized exposure rather than managing individual positions.3  
* **Demand for lstBTC Optimization:** The rising prominence of liquid staked Bitcoin (lstBTC) on CoreDAO, designed for institutions and accredited investors to earn BTC-denominated yield non-custodially while retaining liquidity and existing custody arrangements with trusted custodians like BitGo, Copper, and Hex Trust, creates a clear demand for integrated solutions that can effectively manage and optimize yield for these multi-chain assets.6  
* **Accessibility for All:** As CoreDAO solidifies its position, there is a growing need for user-friendly DeFi entry points that abstract complexity and offer professional-grade asset management to a wider audience.

## **Core Functionality**

### **Core ETF Mechanics**

* **Multi-Asset ETF** \- Diversified exposure to CORE and lstBTC staking. Users benefit from broad market exposure to key CoreDAO assets through a single investment.  
* **Automatic Rebalancing** \- Optimized allocation across staking strategies. The fund intelligently adjusts its holdings to maintain target proportions or capitalize on yield opportunities without user intervention.  
* **NAV Tracking** \- Real-time Net Asset Value calculations. Users can instantly see the current value of their BASKET tokens, reflecting the combined performance of the underlying assets and accrued yields.  
* **Yield Optimization** \- Maximized returns through professional management. StakeBasket actively seeks and allocates capital to the highest-yielding, vetted strategies available within the CoreDAO ecosystem.  
* **Secure Architecture** \- Battle-tested smart contracts with comprehensive testing. We prioritize security, building on audited libraries and conducting extensive internal tests to safeguard user funds.

### **Current Staking Strategies Supported**

* **CORE Staking** \- Delegate to validators with 8% APY target. StakeBasket automates the process of delegating CORE to reliable, high-performing validators within CoreDAO's Satoshi Plus consensus mechanism, where validators are elected based on delegated Bitcoin hash power and staked CORE tokens, optimizing staking rewards.1  
* **lstBTC Integration** \- Liquid staked Bitcoin with auto-compounding. Users gain exposure to yield from liquid staked Bitcoin (lstBTC) assets, which allows institutions to earn BTC-denominated yield non-custodially, without wrapped BTC, bridges, or smart contract risk to principal, as custodians retain hold of the underlying BTC, with rewards automatically reinvested to maximize compounding effects.
* **Dynamic Allocation** \- Responsive to market conditions and yields. The system dynamically reallocates funds to strategies offering the best risk-adjusted returns, adapting to changing market dynamics.  
* **Performance Tracking** \- Transparent reporting of strategy performance. All underlying strategy performance is recorded and made accessible, ensuring full transparency for users.

## **üõ£Ô∏è Future Roadmap & Enhancements**

This section outlines potential enhancements for StakeBasket, designed to deepen its integration with the CoreDAO EVM ecosystem and expand its utility.

### **I. Expanded EVM-Native Staking Strategies**

* **CoreDAO DeFi LP Staking Integration:** Implement strategies to participate in high-yield liquidity pools on prominent CoreDAO decentralized exchanges (DEXs). This would allow StakeBasket to earn trading fees and liquidity incentives from pairs like CORE/USDT, CORE/ETH, or lstBTC/CORE, diversifying yield sources beyond pure staking.  
* **LRT/LSD Integration for CORE:** As the CoreDAO ecosystem matures, integrate with any emerging Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs) or new Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs) specifically designed for CORE, aligning with CoreDAO's explicit plans to introduce more advanced staking features such as Liquid Bitcoin Staking (LSTs) and Bitcoin Re-Staking, building upon its existing stCORE liquid staking solution.3  
* **Yield Aggregator Composability:** Explore integration with existing or future yield aggregation protocols on CoreDAO. By composing with other vaults, StakeBasket could automatically route deposited assets to the best-performing, vetted yield farms across the ecosystem, enhancing overall yield optimization.

### **II. Enhanced BASKET Token Utility & Governance**

* **Decentralized Governance Module:** Implement a robust on-chain governance system for BASKET token holders. This would empower the community to vote on critical protocol parameters, including proposing and approving new staking strategies or asset inclusions; adjusting management or performance fee structures; controlling treasury funds or community grants; and approving smart contract upgrades and major protocol changes.  
* **BASKET Staking for Protocol Fee Sharing:** Introduce a mechanism where users can stake their BASKET tokens in a dedicated governance or fee-sharing module. Staked BASKET would earn a portion of the protocol's collected fees (management, performance, or swap fees), directly incentivizing long-term holding and participation.  
* **Tiered Benefits & Exclusive Access:** Develop a tiered system based on BASKET token holdings. Holding certain amounts of BASKET could unlock benefits such as reduced protocol fees, early access to experimental or higher-yield strategies, or increased voting power in governance.

### **III. Cross-Chain Interoperability & Broader Asset Support**

* **Diverse BTC Asset Support:** While lstBTC is a strong foundation, expand beyond it by exploring integrations with secure and decentralized bridges to directly onboard other forms of Bitcoin (e.g., wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) from Ethereum) into StakeBasket's yield strategies. This positions StakeBasket as a more comprehensive BTC yield hub on CoreDAO, building on CoreDAO's pioneering non-custodial Bitcoin staking solution that has already attracted over $300 million in BTC.5  
* **EVM-Native Composability Showcase:** Actively demonstrate and promote how StakeBasket, as an EVM project, seamlessly composes with other EVM-compatible protocols and tools, leveraging CoreDAO's full EVM compatibility and its LayerZero-powered Core Bridge, which supports seamless asset transfers from major chains like Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Avalanche, and Base.2

### **IV. Advanced Risk Management & Transparency Features**

* **Granular Risk Dashboards:** Provide users with comprehensive, real-time dashboards detailing the specific risk exposure associated with each underlying staking strategy (e.g., smart contract risk, impermanent loss, validator slashing risk). This empowers users with full transparency regarding their investment risks.  
* **Enhanced Oracle Integration:** Beyond the current CoreOracle, explore integrating with additional decentralized oracle networks (e.g., Chainlink, if available on CoreDAO, or other robust, multi-source price feeds). This will ensure even greater resilience and accuracy of asset valuations and performance metrics, mitigating single points of failure.  
* **Emergency Pause Mechanism:** Implement a robust and transparent emergency pause or circuit breaker function, controlled by a multi-signature wallet or decentralized governance. This feature allows for rapid response to critical vulnerabilities in integrated protocols or market black swan events, prioritizing fund protection.

### **V. User Experience & Accessibility Optimizations**

* **Gas Abstraction & Efficiency:** Investigate and implement solutions for abstracting or significantly minimizing gas costs for users. This is particularly important for frequent rebalancing transactions or smaller deposits/withdrawals, addressing a common pain point on EVM chains.  
* **Proactive Notification System:** Develop an opt-in notification system (e.g., via email, Telegram, or push notifications through services like Push Protocol) to alert users about significant events like large rebalancing operations, new strategy deployments, or personal portfolio changes.  
* **Advanced Analytics & Reporting Tools:** Enhance the existing performance tracking with more in-depth analytics. This includes historical yield comparisons against relevant benchmarks, detailed breakdowns of yield sources and collected fees, and potentially simplified data for tax reporting.

### **VI Automated Validator Rebalancing for CORE Staking:**  
   * **Concept:** Implement a sophisticated system to automatically rebalance staked CORE across validators. This would involve continuously monitoring validator performance metrics (e.g., uptime, commission rates, Hybrid Score) and dynamically transferring delegated CORE to ensure optimal yield and minimize exposure to underperforming or risky validators. CoreDAO's stCORE protocol already includes mechanisms like rebalance() and manualRebalance() for this purpose, designed to maintain a balanced distribution of validators and transfer staking from inactive or jailed validators to active ones. 9  
   * **Benefit:** Maximizes yield for CORE stakers by ensuring capital is always delegated to the most efficient and secure validators, and proactively mitigates potential slashing risks.  
### **Integration with CoreDAO's Dual Staking Tiers:**  
   * **Concept:** CoreDAO offers a "Dual Staking" mechanism with tiered reward rates (Base, Super, Boost, Satoshi) that vary based on the ratio of staked CORE to BTC. StakeBasket could introduce specific "BASKET" variants or strategies that automatically optimize for these tiers. For example, a "Satoshi Tier BASKET" could aim to maintain the 8,000 CORE to 1 BTC ratio to achieve the highest rewards, as this tier offers the highest rewards on CoreDAO. 16  
   * **Benefit:** Provides users with more tailored risk/reward profiles and allows them to maximize yield by directly aligning with CoreDAO's native incentive structure, potentially attracting users seeking specific yield optimization strategies.  
### **"Sparks" Point Accumulation & Utility:**  
   * **Concept:** CoreDAO has a "Sparks" points system that measures user engagement and activity within its ecosystem, offering dynamic rewards for participation and contributions. StakeBasket could integrate with this system, allowing users to automatically accumulate Sparks points by holding BASKET tokens or participating in StakeBasket's strategies. Further, explore ways to utilize these accumulated Sparks points within StakeBasket (e.g., for reduced fees, exclusive features) or facilitate their use in the broader CoreDAO ecosystem. 9  
   * **Benefit:** Provides an additional layer of non-financial rewards, deepens user engagement with both StakeBasket and the CoreDAO ecosystem, and creates a unique value proposition.  
### **Governance Participation Proxy for CoreDAO:**  
   * **Concept:** Develop a mechanism where BASKET token holders can signal their preferences or delegate their voting power for CoreDAO's on-chain governance decisions. This could include voting on validator elections, protocol upgrades, or treasury management, all without requiring users to directly manage their staked CORE or BTC. CoreDAO is progressively decentralizing its governance to CORE token holders, and validators are elected based on delegated Bitcoin hash power and staked CORE tokens. 1  
   * **Benefit:** Empowers StakeBasket users to contribute to the decentralization and strategic direction of the CoreDAO network, fostering a stronger community and aligning with Web3 principles.  
### **Advanced Risk Management for Future Restaking:**  
   * **Concept:** As CoreDAO plans for Bitcoin Re-Staking, StakeBasket could proactively develop advanced risk models and transparent dashboards specifically for restaking. This would include clearly communicating additional slashing conditions imposed by Actively Validated Services (AVSs) and potential systemic risks associated with restaking concentration (e.g., if a single validator restakes across multiple AVSs and combined gains from malicious actions could potentially outweigh slashing penalties). 18  
   * **Benefit:** Prepares StakeBasket for future restaking opportunities on CoreDAO, provides users with critical transparency regarding heightened risks, and positions StakeBasket as a responsible and secure platform for advanced yield strategies.

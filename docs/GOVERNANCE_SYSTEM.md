# Enhanced BASKET Token Governance System

## Overview

The Enhanced BASKET Token Governance System transforms the BASKET token from a simple ETF share representation into a powerful governance and value-accrual asset. This system includes three main components:

1. **Decentralized Governance Module** - On-chain voting and proposal system
2. **BASKET Staking for Protocol Fee Sharing** - Revenue sharing mechanism for staked tokens
3. **Tiered Benefits & Exclusive Access** - Hierarchical benefits based on token holdings

## Architecture

### Smart Contracts

#### 1. BasketGovernance.sol
- **Purpose**: Manages decentralized governance proposals and voting
- **Key Features**:
  - Proposal submission and voting
  - Time-locked execution
  - Integration with staking multipliers
  - Delegate voting support

#### 2. BasketStaking.sol
- **Purpose**: Handles BASKET token staking and fee distribution
- **Key Features**:
  - Multi-tier staking system
  - Real-yield protocol fee sharing
  - Voting power multipliers
  - Fee reduction benefits

#### 3. Enhanced StakeBasket.sol
- **Purpose**: Main ETF contract with integrated fee distribution
- **Key Features**:
  - Protocol fee collection (20% of total fees)
  - Automatic fee distribution to stakers
  - Tier-based fee reductions
  - Integration with governance system

## Governance Module

### Proposal Types
1. **Parameter Change** - Modify protocol parameters
2. **Strategy Addition** - Add new yield strategies
3. **Strategy Removal** - Remove underperforming strategies
4. **Fee Adjustment** - Modify fee structures
5. **Treasury Allocation** - Allocate community treasury funds
6. **Contract Upgrade** - Upgrade smart contracts

### Governance Parameters
- **Proposal Threshold**: 1,000 BASKET tokens required to submit proposals
- **Voting Period**: 3 days
- **Execution Delay**: 1 day after successful vote
- **Quorum**: 10% of total BASKET supply must participate
- **Majority**: 51% of votes must be "for" to pass

### Voting Process
1. **Proposal Submission**: Users with â‰¥1,000 BASKET tokens can submit proposals
2. **Voting Period**: 3-day window for community voting
3. **Vote Calculation**: Votes weighted by BASKET holdings + staking multipliers
4. **Execution**: Successful proposals queued for 1-day delay, then executed

## Staking System

### Tier Structure

| Tier | Threshold | Voting Multiplier | Fee Reduction | Additional Benefits |
|------|-----------|------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Bronze** | 100 BASKET | 1.0x | 5% | Basic support |
| **Silver** | 1,000 BASKET | 1.1x | 10% | Priority support |
| **Gold** | 10,000 BASKET | 1.25x | 25% | Early access to strategies |
| **Platinum** | 100,000 BASKET | 1.5x | 50% | Exclusive strategies, premium support |

### Staking Mechanics
1. **Stake BASKET**: Lock tokens to earn protocol fees and tier benefits
2. **Earn Rewards**: Receive ETH from 20% of all protocol fees
3. **Tier Benefits**: Automatic application of fee reductions and voting multipliers
4. **Unstaking**: Immediate unstaking with potential tier downgrades

### Fee Distribution
- **Source**: 20% of all StakeBasket protocol fees (management + performance)
- **Distribution**: Proportional to staked amounts with tier multipliers
- **Claiming**: Users can claim accumulated rewards anytime
- **Real Yield**: Direct ETH rewards from actual protocol revenue

## Integration Features

### Enhanced Voting Power
- Base voting power = BASKET token balance
- Staking multiplier applied based on staked tier
- Example: Platinum staker gets 1.5x voting power on their total holdings

### Fee Reductions
- Applied automatically on ETF deposits
- Higher tiers receive larger reductions
- Effectively increases net yield for loyal token holders

### Governance Integration
- Staking contract address configurable in governance
- Protocol treasury controlled by governance
- Fee percentages adjustable through governance votes

## Deployment Guide

### Prerequisites
- Existing StakeBasket system deployed
- BASKET token contract deployed
- Hardhat development environment

### Deployment Steps

1. **Deploy Governance System**:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-governance.cjs --network <network>
```

2. **Configure Existing Contracts**:
```javascript
// Set staking contract in StakeBasket
await stakeBasket.setBasketStaking(basketStaking.address);

// Set protocol treasury to governance
await stakeBasket.setProtocolTreasury(basketGovernance.address);
```

3. **Verify Contracts**:
```bash
npx hardhat verify --network <network> <BasketStaking-address> <BASKET-token-address> <owner-address>
npx hardhat verify --network <network> <BasketGovernance-address> <BASKET-token-address> <BasketStaking-address> <owner-address>
```

### Configuration Parameters

#### Governance Settings
```javascript
proposalThreshold: "1000000000000000000000", // 1000 BASKET tokens
votingPeriod: 259200, // 3 days in seconds
executionDelay: 86400, // 1 day in seconds
quorumPercentage: 10, // 10%
majorityPercentage: 51 // 51%
```

#### Staking Tiers
```javascript
bronze: { threshold: "100e18", multiplier: 10000, feeReduction: 500 },
silver: { threshold: "1000e18", multiplier: 11000, feeReduction: 1000 },
gold: { threshold: "10000e18", multiplier: 12500, feeReduction: 2500 },
platinum: { threshold: "100000e18", multiplier: 15000, feeReduction: 5000 }
```

## Frontend Integration

### New Routes
- `/governance` - Governance interface for proposals and voting
- `/staking` - Staking interface for BASKET token staking

### Components
- `GovernanceInterface.tsx` - Complete governance UI
- `StakingInterface.tsx` - Staking and tier management UI

### Required Integrations
1. **Contract ABIs**: Import governance and staking contract ABIs
2. **Wagmi Hooks**: Integrate with contract reading/writing
3. **Real-time Updates**: Listen for contract events
4. **Wallet Integration**: Connect with user wallets for transactions

## Security Considerations

### Smart Contract Security
- **Time Locks**: 1-day execution delay for governance proposals
- **Access Controls**: Owner-only functions for critical parameters
- **Reentrancy Guards**: Protection against reentrancy attacks
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive parameter validation

### Governance Security
- **Proposal Threshold**: Prevents spam proposals
- **Voting Periods**: Sufficient time for community participation
- **Quorum Requirements**: Ensures adequate participation
- **Emergency Controls**: Owner can cancel malicious proposals

### Economic Security
- **Fee Caps**: Maximum fee percentages to prevent exploitation
- **Tier Thresholds**: Reasonable requirements for tier benefits
- **Reward Distribution**: Fair and proportional reward sharing

## Testing

### Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: Individual contract function testing
- **Integration Tests**: Cross-contract interaction testing
- **Governance Tests**: Full proposal lifecycle testing
- **Staking Tests**: Tier transitions and reward distribution
- **Security Tests**: Edge cases and attack vectors

### Running Tests
```bash
npx hardhat test test/GovernanceSystem.test.cjs
```

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Key Metrics
- **Governance Participation**: Proposal submission and voting rates
- **Staking Statistics**: Total staked, tier distribution
- **Fee Distribution**: Protocol fees collected and distributed
- **Tier Benefits**: Usage of fee reductions and multipliers

### Events to Monitor
- `ProposalCreated`, `VoteCast`, `ProposalExecuted`
- `Staked`, `Unstaked`, `RewardsClaimed`, `TierUpgraded`
- `ProtocolFeesDistributed`, `FeesCollected`

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Upgrades
1. **Liquid Staking**: Allow trading of staked positions
2. **Advanced Governance**: Quadratic voting, conviction voting
3. **Cross-Chain**: Multi-chain governance and staking
4. **DeFi Integration**: Composability with other protocols
5. **Advanced Analytics**: Detailed governance and staking metrics

### Upgrade Path
- All contracts use OpenZeppelin's upgradeable patterns
- Governance can vote on contract upgrades
- Time-locked upgrade process for security
